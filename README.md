 **Hey welcome to our first project as a group.**
</h1>

It takes great pleasure to introduce you to the first project that we will make as a group. 
This project will be a **retail ecommerce** store with the fundamentals, nothing too fancy. The webapp will be a full stack project using new technologies as we go. Since we are mostly front-end developers, that means that we will have alot of work on our hands.

## Why we build this project. 
The main aim of this project is to allow the contributors to gain a firm understanding of how to work in a group. Since many of us have varying levels of experience working on project, it would be best to know how to work with team members' strengths and weaknesses. 

It is also important to note that the best way to learn is by doing. Experience is the greatest teacher and simply reading and doing simple snippets will not really prepare you for what is to come in the workforce. 

This project aims to build a full blown web app which means that the amount of technologies used won't be just the ones learnt in school. So practice hard and do your best.

## Contributing to the repository. 
<br>

### *Cloning the repository*
First you would need a local copy of the repository to work on. This can be done by cloning the github repo using the command:
<br>

`git clone https://github.com/aldaineclarke/retailWebapp.git`

<br>

### *Installing the dependencies.*
The following command will install the different dependencies necessary to run the project from the package.json file.
<br>

`npm install`

<br>

### *Running the project.*
To run the project you just need to use the command:  
<br>

`npm run devStart`

<br>

in the command prompt. This will run nodemon which will automatically reload the server whenever you make changes to the file.

<br>

### *Making changes to the project.*
Ensure that whatever changes you push to the project is done in the dev branch, **DO NOT PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH**. If you already have a copy of the project on your local machine and you want to post your changes to the `dev` branch; you should first use the command: 
<br>

`git pull origin`

<br>


This command will compare the data you have with the one that is on the remote server (GitHub). It will then say `you are up to date`. Then you can use the command:
<br>

`git push origin`

<br>

If it is not up to date then git will pull more recent changes to your local machine. Afterwhich you need to just commit the changes and push it to the remote server (GitHub).



<br>

## Technologies that will be used. 
To make sure that we are using up to date technologies and tools, we will be choosing the well known technologies and the famous **MEAN** Stack with a little spin.

Some of these Technologies are: 

- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)/ [Angular 13*](https://angular.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  
<br>

## Working as a group.
<br>

### Working with CSS
In order to allow better integration and less conflict, we deem it necessary and prefered if you use the [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction) naming convention when creating styles.

### Working with Angular
Appending **.component**, or **.module** before the end of the respective file should be a must to properly identify what the file is and what it does. 

<br>

## Features of the Webapp
As mentioned above the webapp will have all the fundamental feature of an e-commerce application. These include: 
- Products Listing
- Product Details Page
- Shopping Cart
- User Authentication (Login and Signup);
- User Options(Seller or Customer)
- User Dashboard(Seller)
- User Profile(Customer)
- Orders Page.
- Seller Page(Where the customer can view / contact seller)
- Email Responses
<br>

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
While it is possible to create all this functionality for the application, there may be hiccups and/or we may just choose to give up on this project. Not having any working product for a project would mean that we have wasted hours and days doing nothing. Therefore we will first aim to create a MVP to atleast show that the project was possible to complete. 

The features will include: 
- Products Listing
- Product Details Page
- Shopping Cart
- User Profile (Customer)
- Orders Page. 

<br>

## In Conclusion
### Have Fun!!! Nothing is wrong with mistakes.
We encourage all our contributer not to be afraid of making a mistake. Mistakes help us to realize what we did wrong and, when programming, tells you how to fix them. I don't remember where this quote comes from but it essentially says: 
### *"The only bug free code is a code that is never written"*
